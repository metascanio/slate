# API Introduction 

> API endpoint:

```
https://api.zetascan.com/
```


The Zetascan Query Services `"ZQS"` was created to facilitate the real-time lookup of IP and Domain threat data into various applications and services. Currently there are dozens of various domain and IP data-feeds available to developers. Many of these feeds are available free of charge and some are paid for services when minimum query levels are exceeded. In addition, there are 2 main problems with trying to incorporate multiple data feed into a solution:

1. The overlap between data feed providers in the content listed (IPs & URIs), and

2. The absence of normalised meta-data related to the IPs or Domains.

Because of the above, many developers asked if we could do something to reduce the complexity related to accessing and using threat data as part of their applications - ZQS is our solution. We are introducing a _more elegant API for developers_, with an affordable pricing model to match.

To start, [signup for a developer key](https://zetascan.com/signup/?lang=en) and begin to integrate ZQS into your web-apps and mobile applications. A free-trial for 5,000 API queries is available for a 60-day period.

# Developer library

To ease implementation Zetascan provides developer libraries in various languages. This provides a straightforward way to add ZQS support into your application.

* [Go library](https://github.com/zetascan/go-zetascan)
	* HTTP, text, JSON and JSONx support
	* Support for DNS lookups
	* Example code provided
* [PHP library](https://github.com/zetascan/php-zetascan)
	* HTTP, text, JSON and JSONx support 
* Python and NodeJS library, coming soon.


# Authentication

Authentication to ZQS can be provided via an API key, or specifying your servers' static IP address.

### API key

```shell
curl https://api.zetascan.com/?key=YOURAPIKEY
```

```php
<?
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zetascan.com/?key=YOURAPIKEY');

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
?>
```

> Make sure to replace `YOURAPIKEY` with your API key.

To query the ZQS an API key can be specified as an argument. No API key? [Signup and receive](https://zetascan.com/signup/?lang=en) a key instantly. 

ZQS uses API keys to allow access to the service, and expects the API key to be included in all requests, if IP authentication is not provided.

<aside class="notice">
Zetascan only accepts the API key using SSL/https. If using the http interface without SSL, IP authentication must be used.
</aside>

### IP authentication

Alternatively, authentication to ZQS can be allowed by providing your servers IP address via the [Zetascan dashboard](https://zetascan.com/dashboard/?lang=en).

# API Overview

## Query formats

> Query end-points include 4 formatting options:

```
https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/http/
```

```
https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/text/
```

```
https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/json/
```

```
https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/jsonx/
```

You can issue requests to our endpoints from virtually any operating system or programming language. REST queries are extremely fast and provide the richest set of information about an item.

Each client has unique access key, generated by the system. You need to provide this key, if querying from an unregistered static IP address.

There are four types of REST queries:

* HTTP
* Text
* JSON
* JSONx

The type of desired query is passed in the HTTP request.

## Score calculation

ZQS provides two scoring mechanisms to grade an IP or domain-name for abuse, anti-spam measures, and trustworthiness. 

A negative score, like `-0.1`, means that an item was matched on a known trusted white-list.

If a score is `0`, the item is not found within Zetascan and can be considered neutral.

A score between `0 - 1.0` is a rating on the specified domain or IP address. Scores above `0.35` should be considered as spam or fraudulent.

Reference the [data sources](#data-sources) chapter for more information on feeds used to calculate the scores.

### webscore

Webscore is returned by all query methods, which is used to determine a score for integrating your web-application, mobile-app or protecting your application infrastructure.

### score

Score is also returned by all query methods, and it used to determine a specified IP or domain-name for anti-spam abuse via SMTP, useful for MTA and spam-filters. This score takes into consideration email abuse, and uses a different algorithm from the webscore key.

## Test Cases

### IP Addresses

We provide four IPv4 and four IPv6 addresses, which will always return the same answers. Use these for testing and development:

* `127.9.9.1` - returning as if found in SBL, XBL & CBL
* `127.9.9.2` - returning as if in PBL
* `127.9.9.3` - returning as if in SBL subnet
* `127.9.9.4` - good IP, found in DNSWL, also contains White List data
* `::1, ::2, ::3, ::4` - returning as above for IPv6, except for ::2, which is found both in PBL and DNSWL (example of a false positive)

### Domains

We provide two testing domains:

* `baddomain.org` - returns as if found in all domain DB's: DBL, and all URIBL

* `okdomain.org` - returns as if found in a White List.

## Error handling

When querying ZQS, the following error-codes will be returned if the query or authentication failed. Each query format (Text, HTTP, JSON/JSONx) will embed any error messages in the returned data. Examples on handling errors will be provided for each query format example.

### Error codes

`1` - HTTP 404 - Invalid request - the REST path was wrong, e.g. /v2/check/gson/domain.com. Appears in the message body and in the
x-zetascan-error header. This is the only error that appears like that,
others appears in the specified format as per the documentation.

`2` - HTTP 404 - Missing IP/Domain argument

`3` - HTTP 404 - Failed to parse query's item

`4` - HTTP 403 - HTTPS required to supply API key

`5` - HTTP 403 - Not authorized (request to invalid host, route, port or method, or API method not supported)

`6` - HTTP 403 - Not authorized (request from invalid IP address or with invalid key)

`7` - HTTP 403 - Wrong API Key supplied

`8` - HTTP 404 - HTTP GET request required for queries

`9` - HTTP 403 - Query limit exceeded


# HTTP Format

```shell

x-zetascan-status: success
x-zetascan-score: 1
x-zetascan-sources: DBL;RED;GREY;GOLD;BLACK
x-zetascan-wl: null
x-zetascan-time: 1500970900
x-zetascan-webscore: 0.6

```

```php
<?
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/http/baddomain.org?key=YOURAPIKEY');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

// Request headers only
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, true); 
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);

// Lookup the HTTP status code
$status = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

// Check status codes for a match
if($status == 204) {
    echo "No match in Zetascan blacklist or white-list";

} else if($status == 403)   {
    echo "Request forbidden, check API-key or IP registered";

} else if($status == 200) {

    $headers = array();    
    $data = explode("\n",$response);
    
    $headers['status'] = $data[0];
    
    // Take the HTTP response out, first element
    array_shift($data);
    
    // Build an array for our headers
    foreach($data as $part){
        $middle=explode(":",$part);
        $headers[trim($middle[0])] = trim($middle[1]);
    }

	// Display the score if blacklisted, otherwise if a whitelist
    if( $headers[x-zetascan-score] > 0 || $headers[x-zetascan-webscore] > 0)    {
        echo "Item blacklisted, score " . $headers[x-zetascan-score] . " webscore " . $headers[x-zetascan-webscore];
    } else {
        echo "Item white-listed";
    }
}
?>
```

HTTP returns very simple response - found or not, via HTTP response code. If found, the response will be 200 (OK).

If the item is not present in any black-list/white-list, then the answer will be 204 (No Content).

Additional information about the item is found in the response headers. 

### Response headers

If the query matches, the following HTTP headers will be supplied for additional information.

You can send multiple items in a single request by comma delimitating each IP or domain. This will speed up the overall time for answering your query.

The HTTP headers will contain a response for each query, comma delimitated in sequence from the query specified.


# Text Format

```shell
curl https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/text/baddomain.org?key=YOURAPIKEY
```

```php
<?
// Text method
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/text/baddomain.org?key=YOURAPIKEY');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$response = curl_exec($ch);

// Lookup the HTTP status code
$status = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

// Check status codes for a match
if($status == 204) {
    echo "No match in Zetascan blacklist or white-list";

} else if($status == 403)   {
    echo "Request forbidden, check API-key or IP registered";

} else if($status == 200) {

        // Read the body and split from the specified API formatting
        $head = explode(":", $response);

        if($head[0] == "error") {

            echo "An error occurred " . $head[1];

        } else {

            $str = explode(",", $head[1]);
            
            // $str will contain each field as specified below
            echo "Blacklist hit => " . $str[0] . "\n";
            echo "Whitelist hit => " . $str[1] . "\n";
            echo "Whitelist data => " . $str[2] . "\n";
            echo "Score => " . $str[3] . "\n";
            echo "WebScore => " . $str[4] . "\n";
    
            echo "Sources => ";
    
            // List all sources, comma separated
            for($i = 5; $i < count($str); $i++) {
                echo $str[$i] . ",";
            }

        }
  
}
?>
```

> The above example returns text in the format:

```text
baddomain.org:true,false,,1,0.6,dbl,red,gold,grey,black
```

TEXT returns space separated blocks of information about the lists where the item is found.

Text example - replace 'baddomain.com' with your query - IP or domain:

### Format

Items are separated by space. The format for each item is:

`item:bool,bool,wldata,score,webscore,source`

Where:

* the first bool is true, if found in any black or white list.

* the second bool is true, if found in any white list.

* wldata contains the data from the white list (if present)

* score, returns the score used for MTA/anti-spam abuse.

* webscore, the returned score for web/application abuse.

* sources, a comma separated list of which lists the query was matched on.

### Error handling

If an error occurs using the text query, the data returned will contain the an error prefix, followed by an error message, and the specific error-code.

Example authentication error:

`error:Wrong API Key;7`

Malformed query:

`error:Failed to parse query's item;3`

## Multiple items

> http://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/text/127.9.9.1,127.9.9.2

```
127.9.9.1:true,false,,0.95,0.6,xbl,sbl 127.9.9.2:true,false,,0.2,0,pbl
```

You can send multiple items in a single request by comma delimitating each IP or domain. This will speed up the overall time for answering your query.

The text format, will contain a response for each query, `space` delimitated.


# JSON Format

```shell
curl https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/json/baddomain.org?key= YOURAPIKEY
```

```php
<?
// PHP example with multi-query support, error checking, and JSON data presented
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/json/baddomain.org,okdomain.org,badquery?key=YOURAPIKEY');

} else if($status == 200) {

    $json = json_decode($response, true);

    // Check for any error messages, auth failure, API-key incorrect, etc.
    if( !empty($json["error"]["message"])) {
        echo "An error occurred " . $json["error"]["message"];
    } 

    // Loop through each response ( multiple queries can be delimitated by a comma)
    for($i = 0; $i < count($json["results"]); $i++) {
        
        echo "Query => " . $json["results"][$i]["item"] . "\n";

        // Check for an error message
        if($json["results"][$i]["error"]) {
            echo "An error occurred " . $json["results"][$i]["error"]["message"] . "\n";
            continue;
        }
        
        // Display the results
        print_r($json["results"][$i]);

    }
    
}
?>
```

>Example JSON return string:

```json
{
	"results":[{
		"item":"baddomain.org",
		"found":true,
		"score":1,
		"webscore":0.6,
		"fromSubnet":false,

		"wl":false,
		"wldata":"",
		"lastModified":1500972200
		}],
	"executionTime":2,
	"status":"success"
}
```

The query will return a JSON response including if the item is found on a black-list/white-list, score, sources, etc. Refer to the table below for each field explanation.

<aside class="notice">
The `found` key will be true, if the item is hit in a black-list or white-list. Test the `wl` condition if the item is contained within a white-list. If the score or webscore value is > 0 and `wl` false, the item is contained in a black-list.
</aside>

### JSON response

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
Item | Query value (IP or domain)
Found | True/False if matched in a white-list/black-list.
Score | Score between -0.1 to 1.0 for MTA/Anti-spam abuse. See [score information](#score-calculation)
WebScore | Scorebetween 0.1 to 1.0 for Web/application abuse.
FromSubnet | Will be true, if the IP address was found in a subnet (PBL, SBL)
Sources | Black-Lists matched from ZQS. [See list](#data-amp-access-methods) information.
Wl | If the item matches a white-list.
Wldata | White-Lists matched from ZQS. [See list](#data-amp-access-methods) information.
ExecutionTime | Time in ms for server response
Status | Success or failure

### Error handling

> Example authentication error:

```json
{"error":{"message":"Wrong API Key","errorCode":7}} 
```

>Malformed query:

```json
{"results":
	[{"item":"malformedquery",
	  "error":{
	  	"message":"Failed to parse query's item",
	  	"errorCode":3
	  	}
	}],
	...
}
```

If an error occurred, the JSON response will return an errorCode, message and status within the JSON object.

It is highly recommended to test against the specified error-codes during implementation. Reference the [error handling](#error-handling) section for more information.

## Multiple items

> http://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/json/127.9.9.1,127.9.9.2

	...
	},{
	"item":"127.9.9.2",
	...
	}],
"executionTime":1,
"status":"success"
}
```

You can send multiple items in a single request by comma delimitating each IP or domain. This will speed up the overall time for answering your query.

The JSON format, will contain a response for each query within the `results` array


# JSONx Format

```shell
curl https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/jsonx/baddomain.org?key=yourkeygoeshere
```

```php
<?
$ch = curl_init();

curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/jsonx/127.9.9.1?key=YOURAPIKEY');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

$response = curl_exec($ch);

// Lookup the HTTP status code
$status = curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

// Check status codes for a match
if($status == 403)   {
    echo "Request forbidden, check API-key or IP registered";

} else if($status == 200) {

    $json = json_decode($response, true);

    // Display the array
    print_r($json);

    // Display extended information
    print_r($json["results"][0]["extended"]);
    
}
?>
```

JSONx will return also a JSON document, extended with additional information about the last known activity of an fraudulent IP address. The JSONx format only supports `IP addresses` and not domain queries.

<aside class="success">
Use JSONx if you require extended information regarding the queried host.
</aside>


### JSONx response

Responses include additional information about an IP address with fraudulent activity. This information is found in the 'extended' and 'emailsdaily' fields, e.g.:

## Error handling

Error handling for the JSONx query type is the same as the [JSON error handling](#error-handling-4) section. 

## Multiple items

JSONx support multiple items for a single query, and matches the [JSON multiple-item](#multiple-items-3) format.

# FQDN Queries

```shell
test.baddomain.org;baddomain.org:true,false,,1,0.6,dbl,red,gold,grey,black
```

```json
{"results":[{"item":"test.baddomain.org","found":true,"score":1,"webscore":0.6,"fromSubnet":false,"sources":["shDBL","ubGrey","ubGold","ubRed","ubBlack"],
"wl":false,"wldata":"","lastModified":1500970900,"fromParent":"baddomain.org"}],"executionTime":1,"status":"success"}
```

```shell
x-zetascan-fromParent: baddomain.org
x-zetascan-items: test.baddomain.org
```

We now support sub-domains (FQDN queries). Some BL’s and White Lists have sub-domains listed. If the item is not a direct hit, we will check the parent domain. For example:

https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/{json/jsonx/http/text}/test.baddomain.org

# DNSWL data format

The White List data can have two formats:

"wldata":"1004" or "wldata":"med;domain.com;id". 1004 is a special case of so-called auto-promoted IP addresses. Their reputation is based on automatic detection.

The second format has 3 parts: ranking, domain and ID.

* Ranking can be low, med or high;

* Domain is the registered DNS name of the IP address owner;

* ID can be used to find out more information about the organization at https://www.dnswl.org/s/?s=ID

"wldata" field will have empty string or may be missing, if "wl" is false.

# Browser access

Alternatively, you can test the ZQS using your web-browser. This should be used for test purposes only.

- Point your browser to [https://zetascan.com/query](https://zetascan.com/query)

- Enter one or more IP addresses or domain names;

The service will return list of results with details on where the items were found, query time, and calculated score

Note: a 5 second delay is applied to all anonymous user queries. Please register for an API key to remove this delay.

Alternatively, you can issue a query to our API directly from the browser address bar,
by entring the query REST URL:

https://api.zetascan.com/v2/check/text/baddomain.org?key=YOURAPIKEY

# DNS API

ZQS provides an `rbldns` service that combines the information from all the sources we aggregate.

Multiple query formats are supported, with DNS type records A (ipv4), AAAA (ipv6) and TXT returned.

## Lookup access

ZQS provides lookup access for a domain or IP address against the `*.{APIKEY}.api.zetascan.com` FQDN.

This end-point can be used by MTA/SMTP software such as Exim, Postfix, Sendmail and more, for Anti-spam lookups and abuse prevention. Zetascan is a drop-in replacement for existing RBL services to provide a seamless anti-spam service.

<aside class="notice">
Your API-key must be provided as part of the domain-name query.
</aside>

## Domain query

Domain query:

 `dig A baddomain.org.{key}.api.zetascan.com`

 IPv4 query (213.189.1.4), note the _IP must be reversed_:


`dig TXT 4.1.189.213.{key}.api.zetascan.com`


IPv6 query, note the _IP must be reversed and expanded_:

 `dig AAAA 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.{key}.api.zetascan.com`


<aside class="notice">
Using the domain query will access your ISP or specified name-server as the resolver. This method may cache results, and performance will vary depending on the upline nameserver.
</aside>

## Direct access

Alternatively, you can query `api.zetascan.com` directly as a nameserver and retrieve results. Your IP address must be specified within the [Zetascan dashboard](https://zetascan.com/dashboard/?lang=en) for access to be granted.

<aside class="notice">
If using an on-premise version of Zetascan replace api.zetascan.com with your provided end-point.
</aside>

Domain query:

`dig A @api.zetascan.com baddomain.org`

IPv4 query, note, _IP is not_ reverse formatted.

`dig TXT @api.zetascan.com 127.9.9.4`

IPv6 query:

`dig AAAA @api.zetascan.com ::1`

PTR IPv4 query (used for reverse IP lookups):

`dig PTR @api.zetascan.com PTR 1.9.9.127.in-addr.arpa.`

PTR IPv6 query (used for reverse IP lookups):

`dig PTR @api.zetascan.com 0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.c.b.a.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1.ip6.arpa`

# DNS Response codes

When querying ZQS via DNS two formatting options are returned, TXT or (A, AAAA, PTR)

## TXT format

When querying for the DNS TXT type, if the domain/IP is matched, extended information will be returned for the query.

Query:

`dig TXT @api.zetascan.com 127.9.9.4`

Return response:

`127.9.9.4.		0	IN	TXT	"127.9.9.4:true,true,10;med;zetascan.com;99999,-0.1,-0.1,dnswl"`

The response will be the same format as the [HTTP text](#text-format):

The format for each item is:

`item:bool,bool,wldata,score,webscore,sources`

Where:

* the first bool is true, if found in any black list.

* the second bool is true, if found in any white list.

* wldata contains the [data](#DNSWL-data-format) from the white list (if present)

* score, returns the score used for MTA/anti-spam abuse.

* webscore, the returned score for web/application abuse.

* sources, a comma separated list of which lists the query was matched on.


## A, AAAA, PTR format

When querying via DNS using the A, AAAA, or PTR record types, the following IP addresses will be returned, indicating a match on a specified black-list/white-list, and extended reasons.

Sample dig syntax:

`dig 4.9.9.127.{APIKEY}.api.zetascan.com A`

Returned data:

`4.9.9.127.{APIKEY}.api.zetascan.com. 0 IN A 127.8.10.3`

The IP returned in the 127.X.X.X format is based on the realtime blacklist `RBL` syntax, pioneered by anti-spam and MTA software.

# Data Sources

Currently we derive our results from several providers, including:

* Spamhaus
* Spamhaus real time stream - DBL, SBL and ZRD 
* URIBL - different levels of Domain Black Lists and a Domain White List
* DNSWL - IP adddresses White List

<aside class="notice">
URIBL data can be also used for spam detection, based on URL's (links) inside message body.
</aside>

We also apply internal algorithms for de-duplicating, normalizing and scoring each item in our database, providing a seamless and reliable API end-point for your application.

ZQS queries are answered in less than 1 millisecond, and expect no longer then 10 milliseconds for a query reply.

All our sources are updated at very frequent intervals. We are also using real-time streams, so you may rest assured that you get the latest information from ZQS.

<aside class="notice">
An ZQS virtual appliance is also available for on-premises installation for super-fast access. Please contact us for details about that option.
</aside>

## IP Addresses sources

We aggregate data from several data streams: 

* Spamhaus PBL
* SBL
* XBL
* CBL
* Spamhaus Real-time stream.
* DNSWL IP addresses White List

On the other hand, we have also information about White Lists presence of IP address, for example DNSWL.

Unlike other lists, ZQS analyzes the data about each IP address and provides normalized, de-duplicated, and pre-processed information about each IP address, containing internally calculated score (reputation), last modified timestamp, list of BL / WL where the item appears, etc.

## Domains sources

At this stage we aggregate data from two main Domain providers:

* Spamhaus DBL and URIBL
* Real-time Spamhaus ZRD (Zero Reputation Domains) list.

More providers will be added in the near future. Stay tuned!
